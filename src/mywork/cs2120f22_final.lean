 Give a formal definition of the proposition
 that for every natural number, n, there's a
 natural number, m, that's one more than n.

 /- #C [5 points]. Write a brief English language
 proof of prop1.

 Answer: Assume n is arbitrary. We're to show that 
 there's a one larger number. The number, n + 1,
 satisfies the constraint.
 
 We can show this because every natural number has a
 successor which is equal to itself plus 1.

Define a function, l2n_ni (short for "letters to
numbers, not injective") using "by cases" syntax,
where l2n_ni is not injective. We don't care what
non-injective function you define, as long as it

-- Answer (what makes it non-injective?):
/-
The fact that there are multiple inputs that have the same
output makes it non-injective. In this case, `A` and `B` both
have their output as `one`. This violates the condition of injective
functions that if a relation exists between two inputs and the
same output, the two inputs must be the same.
Formally, `(l2n_ni A one) ‚àß (l2n_ni B one) ‚Üí A = B` is not satisfied,
because A ‚â† B.

Write a brief English-language proof showing that
your function is surjective. You must cite what it
means to be surjective (be mathematically precise).
Hint: You'll have to assume you're given any letter
as input. What you do with that arbitrary value to
complete the proof is the question to answer. Once
you have that, the rest is pretty straightforward.

Answer: This is surjective because every element
of the output space (`nums`) has some corresponding
element in the input space (`lets`) for the function
`l2n_s`.

Formally, this requires that `l2n_s` be single-valued,
and that for every element `num` of `nums`, there exists an element
`let` of `lets` such that `l2n_s let num`.

Give a brief explanation *why* proving these
two "lemmas" proves that the given property 
holds for *every* natural number.

(Skip)

Answer: We are defining the property inductively.
To do this, we show that the property exists
for the base case and the property exists for the
successor of any number. If we want to find the
property for any arbitrary number, we can start from
the base case and find the property for the successor
until we reach our number.

This question tests your understanding of
the induction axiom for natural numbers.

You've learned that there are 2^n possible
"interpretations" of n propositional (i.e.,
Boolean) variables. Now *prove* that this 
is true. We'll help a bit. You fill in the
missing parts. 

1. The property, P, of n, we want to prove 
is that "the number of interpretations of 
a collection of n Boolean variables is 2^n." 

2. What we then want to prove is ‚àÄ n, P n.  

3. What specific proposition do we want
to prove as the "base case" in a proof by
induction? Be mathematically precise.

Answer: We want to prove that there is only
one interpretation of an empty set of variables.

4. What specific proposition do we want to
prove as the "inductive case" in a proof by
induction? Be mathematically precise.

Answer: We want to prove that if we have a set
of n variables with 2^n interpretations, then adding
another variable results in a set of n + 1 variables with
2^(n + 1) interpretations.

5. Which expression in your preceding answer
corresponds to the induction hypothesis.

Answer: that our set of n variables has 2^n interpretations

Answer: We would prove this with induction. First, we would
provide a proof of the base case. Then, we would provide a proof
that for any root, then given its left and right subtrees (and proofs
that they satisfy the property), we can prove that the root satisfies
the property. We would then use the induction axiom to prove that
the property holds for any tree.

Base case. The property holds for the twig case.
Inductive case. Given two trees that satisfy the property,
then a root with those as subtrees will also satisfy the property.
